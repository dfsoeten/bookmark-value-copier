# Bookmark Copier
What is this? Well, simple. If there is a value you need to copy frequently to your clipboard, but you're lazy like me, create a bookmark with the value equal to [source](source.js). Replace `<value you would like to copy here>` with the value you'd like to copy. Only works on Chrome.

## Installation
1. Go [here](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features) and enable `Experimental Web Platform features`, without it this doesn't work. ðŸ¤·
2. Replace `<value you would like to copy here>` in `source.js` to the value of your choosing.
3. Copy the entire script into the URL field of your bookmark.
